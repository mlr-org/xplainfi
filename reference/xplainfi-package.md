# xplainfi: Feature Importance Methods for Global Explanations

Provides a consistent interface for common feature importance methods as
described in Ewald et al. (2024)
[doi:10.1007/978-3-031-63797-1_22](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63797-1_22)
, including permutation feature importance ('PFI'), conditional and
relative feature importance ('CFI', 'RFI'), 'leave-one-covariate-out'
('LOCO'), and 'Shapley Additive Global importancE' ('SAGE'), as well as
feature sampling mechanisms to support conditional importance methods.
